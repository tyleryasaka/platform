# Contributing to Origin.js

Thanks for helping out! üëç

Before you summit a PR, you'll want to make sure that:

1. Any changes are tested.
2. All tests pass. (See each package's readme for instructions on testing that package.) 
3. The formatting is correct. Just run `npm run format` in a package folder.

If this is a new feature, make sure you've discussed it with [our #engineering channel on Discord](https://www.originprotocol.com/discord).


### Coding style: Javascript 

We use [NPM style](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/coding-style), as automated by the [prettier](https://prettier.io) tool. 2 space indents, no semi-semicolons.

### Coding style: Solidity

We use two space indents. Just copy the surrounding style and use your good judgement.
